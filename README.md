This personal development VM with Ansible provisioning is **fully working example**. I created this VM in order to 
have a proper php testbed for my php applications. After vagrant up, the main url will welcome you with phpinfo(). 
I hope you will enjoy this VM and I always accept recommendations and requests.

## Guest OS

I am using the lastest CentOS 7 x64 image from official [Hashicorp](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/centos/7) (thanks)

## Prerequisites / Requirements

- [Virtualbox platform](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [Vagrant](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/)
- guest additions to Vagrant `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html)
- rsync

## How to run

Create your new folder for your project. Clone this repository into that folder, which will download all configuration
needed to run vagrant machine. Then just run `vagrant up` in terminal and the rest will be done automatically. Open up 
terminal and run these commands:

	$ cd /var/www
	$ mkdir project
	$ cd project
	$ git clone https://github.com/skecskes/vagrant-centos7-ansible-lamp.git
	$ cd vagrant-centos7-ansible-lamp/
	$ vagrant up

Note, that if you run it first time, vagrant will download the guest OS (414 MB of Centos 7 in this case) box 
from internet, which in my case took 8 minutes and will save it locally so that vagrant can use it later.

Check vagrant machines : $ vagrant global-status
